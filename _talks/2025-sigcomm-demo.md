During the upcoming ACM SIGCOMM 2025 conference, I got the opportunity to present a demo about Flexicast QUIC. The objective of this demo is to initiate the first Internet measurements of this extension of QUIC.
I leverage Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT, RFC 7450) to connect multicast receivers from the multicast source across non-multicast networks.

All information related to this demo is available here: [https://github.com/louisna/fcquic-sigcomm-demo-2025](https://github.com/louisna/fcquic-sigcomm-demo-2025).
You will find a PDF version of the poster, the README to participate to the demo, as well as the `docker` images of the Flexicast QUIC receivers used for the demo.

## Throwback on SIGCOMM 2025

A lot of things happened during this SIGCOMM edition! [I wrote a blog post about it!](/posts/2025/09/sigcomm-2025)
