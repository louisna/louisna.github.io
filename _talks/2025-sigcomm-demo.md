During the upcoming SIGCOMM 2025 conference, I will get the opportunity to present a demo about Flexicast QUIC. The objective of this demo is to initiate the first Internet measurements of this extension of QUIC.
I leverage Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT, RFC 7450) to connect multicast receivers from the multicast source across non-multicast networks. Do not hesitate to participate during this demo!

I look forward to seeing you there!
