I presented at the QUIC and MBONED working group my work about Flexicast QUIC. I really want to thank Lenny Giuliano (chair of the MBONED) and Lucas Pardue (chair of the QUIC) for the opportunity to present this work to such interesting people.

The IETF draft presenting the Flexicast QUIC extension is available here : https://github.com/IPNetworkingLab/draft-navarre-quic-flexicast.
