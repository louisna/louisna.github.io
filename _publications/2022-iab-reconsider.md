Multicast enables efficient point-to-multi-points
communications. However, due to several deployment issues,
multicast research slowed in the early 2000s and many of its use-
cases were replaced by Content Delivery Networks and unicast
communications. We argue that despite its past deployment
complexities, multicast should be reconsidered to build a more
energy-efficient Internet. We highlight using measurements in
emulated networks the benefits of multicast regarding CPU cycles
and traffic volume. Moreover, we discuss how the past limitations
could be solved with today’s Internet architecture and protocols,
such as the Bit Index Explicit Replication mechanism.
