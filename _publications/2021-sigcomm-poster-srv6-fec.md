IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) is a recent implementation of the source routing paradigm
in IPv6 network. A programmability framework has recently been added to SRv6 and enables it to support diverse
use-cases. We leverage this support to design, implement and assess a Forward Erasure Correction (FEC) technique
that transparently protects IPv6 packets. We implement our encoders and decoders using eBPF on the Linux kernel
and evaluate the benefits that they bring with IoT devices.
